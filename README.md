## HoneyBee

ADA project
The basic HoneyBee algorithm consists of local search ,binary search and waggle dance.These interact with each other to give a big data search search algorithm which uses branch and bound method.
Unlike the basic HoneyBee method this algorithm uses a sorted file which is then stored inside array and the global search algorithm is applied to it .After which this value is returned to the waggle dance which inturn returns this value to local search which finds the elements position.
The shell script sorts the file.
